# Tribute page

## About this project

I have chosen to make a page about one of my favourite composer : Charles-Valentin Alkan.
Even if this is quite a formal exercise, I tried to create an interesting design that follow the spirit of the "topic" :

- Alternating white and black sections to mimic the piano keyboard.
- Create with CSS a musical stave to carry the name and portrait of the composer.
- And use an elegant font B-)

The text itself comes from Alkan's Wikipedia page. That's still better than Lorem Ipsum.
