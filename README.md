# FreeCodeCamp projects

I will archive in this repo all my projects made through the different FreeCodeCamp certifications. You can navigate through the folders or directly use the GitHub page link.

This repo should be updated regularly or not according to the Law of excluded middle and my free time.

Each project has got It's own README with some personal and unpersonal words about It. Have a good exploration!
